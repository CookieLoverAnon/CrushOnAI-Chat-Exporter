# CrushOnAI-Chat-Exporter
Capture chats and export as TXT/HTML.

**Only tested in Firefox with ViolentMonkey**

Instructions: 
Install script to Violentmonkey
Enter the chat you wish to download
If you only want to download your chat as an HTML (Including images in chat), just go to export as HTML
If you only want to download as text, press "capture now", once it's down, go to export as .txt
(Be sure to "clear captured" between chats to avoid duplicating text)
I've included a "read me" section in the script if you want to know what the other options do.

I created this script for myself because I wanted to be able to export my conversations, feed them into ChatGPT, and get a summary to improve the quality of my chats. I added the HTML function for those who wish to preserve their memories off-site. I hope this helps you.
