# CrushOnAI-Chat-Exporter
Capture chats and export as TXT/HTML.

**Only tested in Firefox with ViolentMonkey**

Instructions: 

Install script to Violentmonkey<br>
Enter the chat you wish to download<br>
If you only want to download your chat as an HTML (Including images in chat), just go to export as HTML<br>
If you only want to download as text, press "capture now", once it's down, go to export as .txt<br>
(Be sure to "clear captured" between chats to avoid duplicating text)<br>
I've included a "read me" section in the script if you want to know what the other options do.<br>


I created this script for myself because I wanted to be able to export my conversations, feed them into ChatGPT, and get a summary to improve the quality of my chats. I added the HTML function for those who wish to preserve their memories off-site. I hope this helps you.<br>
