# CrushOnAI-Chat-Exporter
Capture chats and export as TXT/HTML.<br>

**V1.5 - Now easier, cleaner, and includes a clear separation between "AI" and "User" messages.**<br>
**Only tested in Firefox (PC+Android) with ViolentMonkey**

Instructions: <br>
Install script to Violentmonkey<br>
Enter the chat you wish to download<br>
Click "Capture now" and wait for confirmation. Then Proceed to export as either .TXT/HTML.<br>
I've included a "read me" section in the script to explain other features and manual functions in the event of an error.<br>


I created this script for myself because I wanted to be able to export my conversations, feed them into ChatGPT, and get a summary to improve the quality of my chats. I added the HTML function for those who wish to preserve their memories off-site. I hope this helps you.<br>
